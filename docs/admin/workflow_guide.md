# Admin Workflow: Intelligence-Driven Content Management

This document outlines the daily workflow for Saucy AI administrators using the new **Granular Analytics** and **Detailed Download Tracking** systems.

## 1. The Morning Pulse (Dashboard Overview)
*   **Action**: Admin opens the **Analytics** sub-page.
*   **Goal**: Quick health check of the platform.
*   **Interaction**: View the top cards for **Total Downloads**, **Views**, and **Conversion Rate**. 
*   **Insight**: "Total Downloads are up 12%, but Unique Visitors are flat. Our current users are getting more 'Saucy' today."

## 2. Real-Time Activity Monitoring (Recent Downloads)
*   **Action**: Scroll down to the **Recent Downloads** table.
*   **Goal**: Identify "Viral" content as it happens.
*   **Interaction**: The live table shows exactly which GIFs are being pulled right now. 
*   **Insight**: Admin sees *'Confused Travolta'* being downloaded 5 times in the last 2 minutes by both Guest and Authenticated users.
*   **Workflow Pivot**: Because they see this trend, they navigate to the **Content Library** and ensure *'Confused Travolta'* has the best possible tags (e.g., #clueless, #whereisite) to maximize discoverability.

## 3. User Engagement Analysis (Persona Insights)
*   **Action**: Check the **User** column in the Recent Downloads table.
*   **Goal**: Distinguish between power users and casual guests.
*   **Interaction**: Identify users like `admin@saucy.com` (testing) vs genuine community members.
*   **Insight**: Admin notices a specific user email downloading 20+ GIFs in an hour.
*   **Workflow Pivot**: They mark this user for a potential "Sauce of the Month" reward or check for automated scraping behavior if the volume is too high.

## 4. Source Attribution Monitoring
*   **Action**: Filter/View by **Source** badge (Website, Klipy, Extension).
*   **Goal**: Optimize marketing spend and technical support.
*   **Interaction**: Check if the `klipy` source is outperforming the `website`.
*   **Insight**: "Users are using our extension 3x more than the direct site today."
*   **Workflow Pivot**: Admin decides to prioritize the next feature update for the extension rather than the homepage layout.

## 5. Daily Loop Completion
*   **Action**: Hit **Refresh** in the top right.
*   **Goal**: Reset the view for the next shift or hourly check.
*   **Verification**: Ensure all pending GIFs in the **Review Queue** are cleared, guided by what's currently trending in the Analytics view.
