# Skill Suggestion Protocol

After the user enters a prompt, scan for relevance to existing skills:

## Skills Library Location

`C:\Users\brnta\OneDrive\Desktop\Antigravity SKills\`

## When to Suggest Skills

**Design/UI request?** → Check `1-Profile/design-preferences.md`
**Debugging issue?** → Check `3-Technical/debugging-playbook.md`  
**Firebase/deployment?** → Check `3-Technical/firebase-deploy.md`
**New project setup?** → Check `1-Profile/tech-stack.md`
**AI integration?** → Check `3-Technical/ai-integration.md`
**Planning/roadmap?** → Check `2-Planning/project-dashboard.md`
**Code pattern needed?** → Check `3-Technical/code-snippets.md`

## How to Suggest

If a skill seems relevant, say:
> "I notice this relates to your **[skill-name]** skill. Want me to apply those preferences?"

Then offer to read the skill file if they confirm.

## User Can Also Invoke

- "Use my design preferences"
- "Apply my debugging playbook"
- "Check my tech stack skill"
